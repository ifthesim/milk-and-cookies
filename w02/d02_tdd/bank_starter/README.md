# AddBass International Bank

## What do?
- You have been provided with a full set of test specs in the bank_starter/spec/bank_spec.rb file.
- Read through these tests to get a general idea of what you will need to do in order to make them pass.
- Work through one test at a time, writing code in the bank_starter/lib/bank.rb file to satisfy the test.
- After each chunk of code you write, run the `rspec` command in the bank_starter directory to see if your tests pass.
- Continue!
