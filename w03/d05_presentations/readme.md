# Project 1 Presentations

## Schedule

### Reflection & Refactor (10:30 - 12:00)

Find one or two other people who had the same prompt. Review each other's code, make any necessary last minute adjustments.

### Science Fair Presentations (1:30 - 4:15)

(See below for description of the science fair format)

* **1:30 - 2:15** - Flashcards Science Fair 
* **2:30 - 3:15** - Personal Finance Science Fair 
* **3:30 - 4:15** - Battleship Science Fair 

### Retrospective (4:30 - 5:00)

We'll hold a short retro to discuss what went well, what we learned, and what we'd like to do differently next time.

## Presentation Format
These aren't really presentations. The format's almost exactly the same as the "meet and greet" where GA grads meet with prospective employers. (But without the prospective employers... just WDI students.)

### The structure

There will be three chunks of presentation time, one for each of the project prompts. All those with that prompt will stand at tables with their computers on crates, while the other students walk from table-to-table.

### What do I talk about?

Since this will be pretty informal, that's up to you! But here are some ideas:

- The gimme: Walk an audience member through using your app.

- Walk through your user stories. Why would someone want to use your app?

- Describe your thought process. Show off your ERDs and user stories. These are really compelling to audiences -- people love seeing how other people think!

- What "leapt out" at you when you first read your prompt? How did that affect what you created?

- Did you add any personal touches? Challenge your audience to find any easter eggs you might have hidden!

- What ideas do they have for functionality you could add? How would they have done things differently?
