# Homework Submission Roolz

All homework assignments will have their own repository, under the `ga-dc` account.

Please **fork** new assignments. Then, **clone** your fork to your computer. Complete your work inside it. Then, **push** your completed work to your forked repository. Finally, make a **pull request** to the upstream repository (in `ga-dc`).

As always, please include:

1. Your **comfort** score, out of 5.

2. Your **completeness** score, out of 5.

3. A brief note describing where you stopped, what in particular you had trouble with, what went well, and anything else you feel like including!

**Even if you're not done, please make sure you've made a pull request with what you have completed by 9:00am each day.**
