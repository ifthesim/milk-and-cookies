# Presentation Guide

## Schedule

Presentation will be held on Friday from 1:30 - 5:00pm in classrooms 1 & 2. (Each classroom will have 7 teams).

## Goal

Your team is the staff of a start-up company. The instructors are (collectively) the CEO of your company. USA Today is a potential investor interested in funding a product on which you’re working.

Your job is to present the product to your CEO such that the CEO can, in turn, present it to USA Today to secure the investment.

Your presentation should enable the CEO to:
* Describe the role of each member of your team. In order to feel in-touch with the staff, the CEO expects each teammember to explain what their role was, and to explain and demonstrate what they worked on.
* Illustrate the problem and user stories your product is intended to address.
* Be aware of the shortcomings of your product so the CEO can know what not to demonstrate to the investors.
* Highlight the most compelling aspects of your product — what looks the best, and what works the best.
* Demonstrate the use of the product.
* Explain what’s next: what features would your team like to add to the product next?
* Describe the initial reaction from your userbase.
