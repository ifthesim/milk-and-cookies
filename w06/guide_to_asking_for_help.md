# How to Ask Questions

the information that must be included when submitting an issue. It is expected
that you will try to debug/solve an issue prior to submitting a request for help
on Github.

includes but is not limited to:

- What you are trying to do (in terms of code)
- Detailed description of the bug or error
- Relevant code/files/errors (and screenshots if applicable)
- Gems and/or other technologies being used (if applicable)

### What have you tried?

not limited to:
- Documentation you have looked at
