Create a function that will set up a working directory for a new GA student!

Things it should do:

-	Create a folder called `GeneralAssembly`

-	Create 4 sub-folders in `GeneralAssembly`: `Homework`, `Notes`, `Projects`, and `Outcomes`

-	Create a sub-folder in `Homework` and `Notes` called `week01`

-	Create a sub-folder in each `week01` folder called `day01`

-	Create a file in `GeneralAssembly` called `README.md` that contains a brief message from you to the student, telling them something along the lines of, "Keep calm and carry on"

-	Print a message saying, "Hey there, student! Welcome to WDI6! I just set up this directory tree for you:"

-	Print a tree showing the contents of the GeneralAssembly directory. It should look something like this:

-	GeneralAssembly/
	-	Homework/
		-	week01/
			-	day01/
	-	Notes/
		-	week01/
			-	day01/
	-	Projects/
	-	Outcomes/
	-	README.md
