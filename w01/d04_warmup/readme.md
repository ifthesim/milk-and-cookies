# Haiku on Github

* Find a partner
* Create a new GH repo, 'cold_day'
  * Don't initialize it with a readme!
* Clone the repo to your local machine
* Use “git status” to see the status of the repo
* Use “git remote -v" to see list remotes
* Create a file for your haiku.
* Add a line to your haiku, and use add / commit them locally
  * Did it change on GitHub?
* Use "git push" to push changes to GitHub
* Ask your partner to fork the repo, and clone the fork.
* That partner should add a line to the file, then git add, commit, and push.
* The original creator should 'git pull'
* Flip roles and repeat.
