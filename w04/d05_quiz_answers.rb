# Number 5
# Given the following:

def get_words(word_type, word_category, word_index)
  madlibs_options = {
    :noun => {:names => ["Robin", "Matt", "Andy"],
              :objects => ["Chair", "Platypus", "Cheeto"]},
    :verb => {:happy => ["Dance", "Jam Out", "Play", "Code"],
              :mean => ["Fight", "Yell", "Stab"]},
    :adjective => {:funny => ["Weird", "Special", "Squishy"],
                   :physical => ["Solid", "Tall", "Stumpy"]}
  }
  madlibs_options[word_type][word_category][word_index]
end

def madlib_sentence(noun, verb, adjective)
  puts "The #{noun} can #{verb} in a #{adjective} manner"
end

noun = get_words(:noun, ?, ?)
verb = get_words(?, :happy, ?)
adjective = (?, ?, 2)
madlib_sentence(noun, verb, adjective)

=begin

“The Platypus can Jam Out in a Stumpy manner”
=end

## Number 5: Answer
noun = get_words(:noun, :objects, 1)
verb = get_words(:verb, :happy, 1)
adjective = get_words(:adjective, :physical, 2)
madlib_sentence(noun, verb, adjective)
